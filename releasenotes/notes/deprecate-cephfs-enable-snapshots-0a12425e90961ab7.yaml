deprecations:
  - |
    The parameter 'manila::backend::cephfs::cephfs_enable_snapshots' has been
    deprecated. Manila's CephFS driver has changed the default behavior in
    the Victoria cycle to always support snapshots, because they are fully
    supported in Ceph Nautilus, the minimum version of Ceph supported by
    Manila. Since the ``cephfs_enable_snapshots`` config option will be removed
    in a future release, we recommend that you stop relying on it. Manila's
    snapshots can be disabled by virtue of share type extra specs if
    desired.
