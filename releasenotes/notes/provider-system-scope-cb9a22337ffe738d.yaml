upgrade:
  - |
    Now the ``manila_type`` resource type uses system scope credential instead
    of project scope credential when sending requests to Manila API.

deprecations:
  - |
    Currently the manila_type`` resource type uses the credential written in
    the ``[keystone_authtoken]`` section of ``manila.conf``. However this
    behavior has been deprecated and now the resource type first looks for
    the yaml files in ``/etc/openstack/puppet``. Make sure one of
    ``clouds.yaml`` or ``admin-clouds.yaml`` (which is created by
    puppet-keystone) is created in that directory.
